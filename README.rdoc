Buzz You In allows residents of apartment complexes that have callboxes to send visitor passes to visitors for easier access.

It works like this:

1. Resident sends guest a visitor pass via text message.

2. Guest replies to text message when in front of callbox.

3. Guest "calls" resident via callbox and is automatically buzzed in.

Currently a work in progress, but should be done soon. Cheers!
